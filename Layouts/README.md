# vMix Layout presets
While vMix includes a number of layer layouts, I don't love that they never include the background as layer 1.

In this folder is my collection of layer templates arranged by the number of sources and *x* for the general arrangment on a 1920x1080 canvas.

Example: Five+BG 3x2  is a layout that's first layer is a background behind everything with three boxes across the top and two larger boxes across the bottom.
